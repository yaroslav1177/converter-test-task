# Currency Converter project

This project is a currency converter application built with Angular and TypeScript. It fetches real-time exchange rates for USD and EUR to UAH from the National Bank of Ukraine's public API and displays them in a header component. The main feature includes a dynamic currency converter allowing users to convert between these currencies, with a reset button to restore default values. The design leverages Tailwind CSS for styling and Angular Material for UI components.
